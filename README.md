# Repeating Reciprocals

Inspired by [this Numberphile video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmfxIhmGPP4] and [William Shanks|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shanks].

Given an input number, calculates the number of digits of the reciprocal until it repeats.

Example: `node shanks-bot.js 60029`
